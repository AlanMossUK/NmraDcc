sentence=Enables NMRA DCC Communication 
paragraph=This library allows you to interface to a NMRA DCC track signal and receive DCC commands. The library currently supports the AVR ATTiny84/85 & ATMega88/168/328/32u4 and Teensy 3.x using the INT0/1 Hardware Interrupt and micros() ONLY and no longer uses Timer0 Compare Match B, which makes it much more portable to other platforms. ALSO BEWARE as of version 1.4.4 support for the call-back functions notifyDccAccState() and notifyDccSigState() has been removed, please check and update your sketches, as they will silently fail.
